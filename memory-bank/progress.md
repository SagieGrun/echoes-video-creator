    - **Removed confusion**: No more click-to-jump positioning or selection-connected dragging
  - **Music Integration**: Audio preview and volume controls
  - **Settings Panel**: Transition types and compilation options
  - **Database**: `final_videos` table for storing finalization settings

#### **‚úÖ Corrected Plan (Final)**: Hybrid Next.js Deployment
- **Frontend**: Next.js with intelligent static/serverless routing
- **Static Pages**: Marketing, create, login (served from CDN)
- **Server Routes**: `/auth/callback` (secure OAuth handling)
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Functions (already migrated)
- **Platform**: Vercel/Netlify with automatic optimization
