## Lessons Learned üìö

### Next.js API Routes vs Supabase Edge Functions
**Major Lesson**: Next.js API routes are NOT suitable for complex backend operations when debugging visibility is critical.

**What Went Wrong with Next.js API Routes:**
- ‚ùå Poor debugging experience (terminal console.log only)
- ‚ùå No structured error tracking or monitoring
- ‚ùå Difficult to trace request flows and identify issues
- ‚ùå Limited visibility into API performance and bottlenecks
- ‚ùå Complex deployment and scaling requirements

**Why Supabase Edge Functions Are Superior:**
- ‚úÖ Built-in logging dashboard with real-time monitoring
- ‚úÖ Structured error tracking with full stack traces
- ‚úÖ Request/response tracing and performance metrics
- ‚úÖ Automatic scaling and reliability
- ‚úÖ Simple deployment with Supabase CLI
- ‚úÖ Integrated with Supabase ecosystem (auth, database, storage)

**Key Takeaway**: For any future projects requiring backend API operations, prioritize platforms with superior debugging and monitoring capabilities over developer familiarity.
