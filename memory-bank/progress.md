  - Confirmed hybrid Next.js deployment model as correct approach
- **Architecture Validation**: Verified all components working together correctly

### üéØ Current Status: Ready for Production

**‚úÖ What's Working:**
- **Complete Generation Pipeline**: Upload ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí Runway API ‚Üí Status Updates ‚Üí Clip Display
- **Superior Debugging**: Real-time logs in Supabase Dashboard with structured error tracking
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth with secure server-side callback handling
- **File Upload**: Private storage with proper user isolation and signed URLs
- **Admin Panel**: System configuration and credit pack management
- **Database**: All operations with RLS protection and proper schema
- **Build Process**: TypeScript compilation and production builds working

**‚úÖ What's Tested:**
- End-to-end clip generation workflow
- Authentication and authorization flows
- File upload and processing
- Error handling and recovery
- Admin configuration management
- Production build verification

**‚úÖ Technical Achievements:**
- **Debugging Experience**: DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED from console.log to real-time dashboard
- **API Performance**: STABLE with auto-scaling Edge Functions
- **Error Tracking**: COMPREHENSIVE with structured logging and stack traces
- **Build Process**: RELIABLE with consistent TypeScript compilation

### üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT DECISION CORRECTED

#### **‚ùå Original Plan (Flawed)**: Static Export
- Planned to use `output: 'export'` for purely static deployment
- **FATAL FLAW**: OAuth callback `/auth/callback` requires server-side logic
- **Cannot Work**: Static sites cannot handle secure OAuth code exchange

#### **‚úÖ Corrected Plan (Final)**: Hybrid Next.js Deployment
- **Frontend**: Next.js with intelligent static/serverless routing
- **Static Pages**: Marketing, create, login (served from CDN)
- **Server Routes**: `/auth/callback` (secure OAuth handling)
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Functions (already migrated)
- **Platform**: Vercel/Netlify with automatic optimization

### ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Production Deployment** üöÄ HIGH PRIORITY
