# Active Context - Echoes Video Creator

## Current Phase: Phase 0 - Setup & Foundation

### Current Focus
Setting up the foundational infrastructure for the Echoes Video Creator MVP, with a focus on auth-first approach and simplified video handling.

## Immediate Tasks (Phase 0)

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Memory bank documentation setup
- Architecture decisions finalized
- Technical stack confirmed
- Next.js 14 project initialized with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS configured
- Basic project structure created
- TypeScript interfaces defined
- Supabase client configuration
- **Google OAuth implementation and debugging**
  - Fixed login page to use centralized Supabase client
  - Implemented proper OAuth callback handling
  - Configured post-login redirect to `/create` page
  - Tested end-to-end authentication flow

### üöß In Progress
- Database schema implementation
- Storage bucket configuration (private only)

### ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Up (Phase 1)
- Implement auth-first flow
- Upload wizard with clip approval
- Sequential clip player

## Key Decisions Made

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (all-in-one solution)
- **AI Model**: Pluggable provider (start with Runway)
- **Payments**: Stripe (USD only)
- **Auth**: Google OAuth only (required first)
- **Video Handling**: Sequential playlist (no stitching)
- **Storage**: Private buckets only (auth required)

### Business Constraints
- **Maximum Simplicity**: Auth-first, no temporary states
- **English + USD Only**: Global expansion later
- **Mobile-First**: PWA with offline capabilities
- **Low Scale Initially**: <50 users in MVP phase
- **Cost Target**: $0.25 per clip generation

### Development Approach
- **Auth-First**: All features behind login
- **Clip Approval**: Manual confirmation for each clip
- **Simple Playback**: Sequential playlist instead of stitching
- **Clean Setup**: Comprehensive documentation and tooling

## Current Blockers
- Need to set up Google OAuth in Supabase
- Need to update database schema for clip approval

## Environment Setup Status

### Required Accounts
- [ ] Supabase project + Google OAuth
- [ ] Stripe account  
- [ ] Runway API access
- [ ] Vercel/Netlify deployment

### Database Schema Updates
- [ ] Add `approved` boolean to clips table
- [ ] Update RLS policies for auth-first approach
- [ ] Create referral tracking tables

## Next Phase Preview (Phase 1)

### Phase 1: Free Clip Flow
Will focus on the core user experience:
1. **Homepage + Upload UI**: Emotional landing page with photo upload
2. **Clip Preview & Generation**: AI integration with status tracking
3. **Signup Enforcement**: Google Auth for download/share

### Success Criteria for Phase 0
- [ ] Project fully initialized and running locally
- [ ] All external services configured and tested
- [ ] Database schema deployed and functional
- [ ] Authentication working end-to-end
- [ ] Development workflow documented and tested

## Notes for Next Session
- Keep focus on simplicity throughout implementation
- Test each service integration before moving to next phase  
- Document any issues or decisions in this file
- Update progress.md after Phase 0 completion

## Recent Work (December 2024)
- **Authentication System Completed**: Google OAuth fully working
  - Fixed client initialization issues in login page
  - Implemented proper callback handling with error logging
  - Configured correct post-login redirect flow to `/create`
- **User Flow Optimized**: Login now redirects directly to image upload
- **Code Quality**: Standardized Supabase client usage across components
