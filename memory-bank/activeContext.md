## Current Phase: Phase 1 - Architecture Migration & Codebase Review ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### üéâ MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED
**EDGE FUNCTIONS MIGRATION COMPLETED**: Successfully migrated from Next.js API routes to Supabase Edge Functions for all core backend operations.

### ‚úÖ Migration Completed Successfully
- **clip-generation** Edge Function: Complete clip generation workflow deployed
- **clip-status** Edge Function: Status polling with database updates deployed  
- **clip-details** Edge Function: Clip information retrieval deployed
- **Frontend Integration**: ClipGeneration.tsx updated to use Edge Functions
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens properly passed to Edge Functions
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Superior debugging experience achieved via Supabase Dashboard

### üîç Comprehensive Codebase Review Completed
**PROBLEM IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED**: Found and fixed several issues from the migration:

#### **‚úÖ Issues Found & Fixed:**
1. **Old API Routes Cleanup**: Removed deprecated `/api/clips/*` routes and unused utilities
2. **Environment Variable Fix**: Corrected `RUNWAY_API_SECRET` ‚Üí `RUNWAY_API_KEY` inconsistency in Edge Functions
3. **Unused File Cleanup**: Removed `runway.ts` and `image-processor.ts` from src/lib (migrated to Edge Functions)
4. **Build Verification**: Confirmed TypeScript compilation and production build success

### üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT DECISION CORRECTED

#### **‚ùå Original Plan (Flawed)**: Static Export
- Planned to use `output: 'export'` for purely static deployment
- **FATAL FLAW**: OAuth callback `/auth/callback` requires server-side logic
- **Cannot Work**: Static sites cannot handle secure OAuth code exchange

#### **‚úÖ Corrected Plan (Recommended)**: Hybrid Next.js Deployment
- **Frontend**: Next.js with intelligent static/serverless routing
- **Static Pages**: Marketing, create, login (served from CDN)
- **Server Routes**: `/auth/callback` (secure OAuth handling)
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Functions (already migrated)
- **Platform**: Vercel/Netlify with automatic optimization

### üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture Status

**‚úÖ Fully Operational:**
- **Core Generation Pipeline**: Upload ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí Status Polling ‚Üí Clip Display
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth with secure server-side callback
- **Database**: All operations working with proper RLS
- **Storage**: Private photo uploads with signed URLs
- **Admin Panel**: Configuration management (using Next.js API routes - intentionally kept simple)

**‚úÖ Debugging Experience Achieved:**
- Real-time logs in Supabase Dashboard
- Structured error tracking with stack traces
- Performance monitoring and request tracing
- **Original goal of better debugging visibility: FULLY ACHIEVED**

### üìã Remaining Admin API Routes (Intentionally Kept)
These remain as Next.js API routes for simplicity:
- `/api/admin/auth` - Simple password validation
- `/api/admin/credits` - Credit pack management
- `/api/admin/system-prompt` - System prompt configuration
- `/api/admin/models` - Model provider configuration

**Rationale**: Simple CRUD operations that don't need complex external API integration or advanced debugging.

## Key Decisions Made

### Technical Architecture (FINAL)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (Hybrid: Static + Serverless) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno runtime) for core APIs
- **Authentication**: Next.js server-side routes (OAuth callback requirement)
- **Admin Panel**: Next.js API routes (simple CRUD operations)
- **AI Integration**: Runway ML Gen-4 Turbo via Edge Functions
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (private buckets)
- **Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify (hybrid deployment model)

### Architecture Decision: Hybrid Deployment Model
**Why Not Static Export:**
- OAuth callback requires server-side code execution
- Secure session management needs server-side cookie handling
- Authentication security cannot be compromised

**Why Hybrid Model:**
- Best of both worlds: static performance + server capabilities
- Platform-optimized deployment (CDN + serverless functions)
- Standard Next.js deployment pattern
- Maintains full security model

**Why Edge Functions for Core APIs:**
- **Superior debugging**: Real-time dashboard logs vs console.log
- **Better monitoring**: Structured error tracking and performance metrics
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling serverless functions
- **Development experience**: Integrated logging and error tracking

### Development Approach (CONFIRMED)
- **Auth-First**: All features behind login, including free clip
- **Admin-Configurable**: System prompts and pricing via admin panel
- **Edge Functions**: Complex APIs with external integrations
- **Next.js API Routes**: Simple admin CRUD operations
- **Hybrid Deployment**: Static frontend + serverless backend
