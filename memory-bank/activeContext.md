# Active Context - Echoes Video Creator

## Current Phase: Phase 1 - Video Storage & Finalization Features ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### üéâ MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED
**VIDEO FINALIZATION WORKFLOW COMPLETED**: Successfully implemented complete music management and video finalization system with intuitive drag-and-drop UX.

### ‚úÖ Latest Work Completed Successfully

#### **Phase 1H: Video Storage & Finalization UX** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Critical Video Storage Fix**: Resolved video URL expiration issue
  - **Problem Identified**: Runway provides temporary URLs that expire, causing 401 errors for users
  - **Solution Implemented**: Modified `clip-status` Edge Function to download videos from Runway and store permanently
  - **Database Schema**: Added `video_file_path` column to clips table for permanent storage tracking
  - **Frontend Updates**: Dashboard and finalize pages now generate fresh signed URLs for videos
  - **Result**: Videos remain permanently accessible, eliminating user frustration
- **Music Management System**: Complete admin interface for background music
  - **Admin Panel**: Added Music tab to admin navigation at `/admin/music`
  - **Upload Interface**: Simple file upload with filename-as-title functionality
  - **API Implementation**: Full CRUD operations for music library management
  - **Database Integration**: `music_tracks` table with proper RLS policies
  - **Storage Setup**: Public `music-tracks` bucket for audio file storage
- **Video Finalization Interface**: Complete user workflow for creating final videos
  - **Finalization Page**: `/finalize` page with clip selection, music choice, and settings
  - **Drag & Drop Redesign**: Completely rebuilt with standard UX patterns:
    - **Problem**: Previous implementation connected dragging to selection highlighting and had confusing click-to-reorder
    - **Solution**: Separated selection grid from draggable reorder list
    - **Visual Feedback**: Blue drop lines, drag handles, order numbers for clear position indication
    - **Standard Flow**: Click to select clips ‚Üí Drag selected clips to reorder ‚Üí Clear visual feedback
    - **Removed Confusion**: Eliminated click-to-jump positioning and selection-connected dragging
  - **Music Integration**: Audio preview controls and volume adjustment
  - **Settings Panel**: Transition types and compilation configuration
  - **Database Schema**: `final_videos` table for storing user finalization settings

### üîç User Experience Improvements Made

#### **‚ùå Previous Drag UX Issues (Fixed):**
1. **Confusing Connection**: Dragging was connected to selection highlighting
2. **Missing Position Indicators**: No visual feedback showing where you're dropping
3. **Click-to-Reorder**: Confusing click functionality that jumped positions
4. **Guessing Game**: Users had to guess drop positions

#### **‚úÖ New Standard Drag UX (Implemented):**
1. **Separated Areas**: Selection grid vs. dedicated draggable reorder list
2. **Clear Drop Indicators**: Blue drop lines show exactly where you're dropping
3. **Standard Patterns**: Drag handles, order numbers, visual feedback users expect
4. **Intuitive Flow**: Click to select ‚Üí See selected clips in order ‚Üí Drag to reorder
5. **No Confusion**: Removed all non-standard interaction patterns

### üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture Status

**‚úÖ Fully Operational & Enhanced:**
- **Core Generation Pipeline**: Upload ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí Status Polling ‚Üí **Permanent Storage** ‚Üí Clip Display

- **Music Integration**: COMPLETE workflow from admin upload to user selection
- **Finalization Flow**: INTUITIVE clip selection and video creation process

### üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT DECISION CORRECTED

#### **‚ùå Original Plan (Flawed)**: Static Export
- Planned to use `output: 'export'` for purely static deployment
- **FATAL FLAW**: OAuth callback `/auth/callback` requires server-side logic
- **Cannot Work**: Static sites cannot handle secure OAuth code exchange

#### **‚úÖ Corrected Plan (Recommended)**: Hybrid Next.js Deployment
- **Frontend**: Next.js with intelligent static/serverless routing
- **Static Pages**: Marketing, create, login (served from CDN)
- **Server Routes**: `/auth/callback` (secure OAuth handling)
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Functions (already migrated)
- **Platform**: Vercel/Netlify with automatic optimization

### üìã Remaining Admin API Routes (Intentionally Kept)
These remain as Next.js API routes for simplicity:
- `/api/admin/auth` - Simple password validation
- `/api/admin/credits` - Credit pack management
- `/api/admin/system-prompt` - System prompt configuration
- `/api/admin/models` - Model provider configuration

**Rationale**: Simple CRUD operations that don't need complex external API integration or advanced debugging.

## Key Decisions Made

### Technical Architecture (FINAL)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (Hybrid: Static + Serverless) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno runtime) for core APIs
- **Authentication**: Next.js server-side routes (OAuth callback requirement)
- **Admin Panel**: Next.js API routes (simple CRUD operations)
- **AI Integration**: Runway ML Gen-4 Turbo via Edge Functions
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (private buckets)
- **Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify (hybrid deployment model)

### Architecture Decision: Hybrid Deployment Model
**Why Not Static Export:**
- OAuth callback requires server-side code execution
- Secure session management needs server-side cookie handling
- Authentication security cannot be compromised

**Why Hybrid Model:**
- Best of both worlds: static performance + server capabilities
- Platform-optimized deployment (CDN + serverless functions)
- Standard Next.js deployment pattern
- Maintains full security model

**Why Edge Functions for Core APIs:**
- **Superior debugging**: Real-time dashboard logs vs console.log
- **Better monitoring**: Structured error tracking and performance metrics
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling serverless functions
- **Development experience**: Integrated logging and error tracking

### Development Approach (CONFIRMED)
- **Auth-First**: All features behind login, including free clip
- **Admin-Configurable**: System prompts and pricing via admin panel
- **Edge Functions**: Complex APIs with external integrations
- **Next.js API Routes**: Simple admin CRUD operations
- **Hybrid Deployment**: Static frontend + serverless backend
