# Active Context - Echoes Video Creator

## Current Phase: Phase 0 - Setup & Foundation

### Current Focus
Setting up the foundational infrastructure for the Echoes Video Creator MVP, including project initialization, external service configuration, and development environment.

## Immediate Tasks (Phase 0)

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Memory bank documentation setup
- Architecture decisions finalized
- Technical stack confirmed
- Next.js 14 project initialized with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS configured
- Basic project structure created
- TypeScript interfaces defined
- Supabase client configuration
- Development environment tested
- README with setup instructions

### üöß In Progress
- External services setup (user action required)

### ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Up (Phase 1)
- Homepage + Upload UI implementation
- Clip preview & generation UX
- Signup enforcement flow

## Key Decisions Made

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS (PWA)
- **Backend**: Supabase (all-in-one solution)
- **AI Model**: Runway Gen-3 Alpha API (~$0.05-0.10/clip)
- **Payments**: Stripe (USD only)
- **Auth**: Google OAuth only
- **Video Processing**: Browser-based assembly (simple)
- **Queue**: Database polling (no external service)

### Business Constraints
- **Maximum Simplicity**: Choose simple over complex
- **English + USD Only**: Global expansion later
- **Mobile-First**: PWA with offline capabilities
- **Low Scale Initially**: <50 users in MVP phase
- **Cost Target**: $0.25 per clip generation

### Development Approach
- **Phased Development**: Following the 6-phase plan
- **MVP Focus**: Only essential features for validation
- **Quick Iteration**: Architecture supports rapid changes
- **Clean Setup**: Comprehensive documentation and tooling

## Current Blockers
None - proceeding with Phase 0 setup tasks.

## Environment Setup Status

### Required Accounts
- [ ] Supabase project
- [ ] Stripe account  
- [ ] Runway API access
- [ ] Vercel/Netlify deployment

### Development Environment
- [ ] Next.js project initialized

## Next Phase Preview (Phase 1)

### Phase 1: Free Clip Flow
Will focus on the core user experience:
1. **Homepage + Upload UI**: Emotional landing page with photo upload
2. **Clip Preview & Generation**: AI integration with status tracking
3. **Signup Enforcement**: Google Auth for download/share

### Success Criteria for Phase 0
- [ ] Project fully initialized and running locally
- [ ] All external services configured and tested
- [ ] Database schema deployed and functional
- [ ] Authentication working end-to-end
- [ ] Development workflow documented and tested

## Notes for Next Session
- Keep focus on simplicity throughout implementation
- Test each service integration before moving to next phase  
- Document any issues or decisions in this file
- Update progress.md after Phase 0 completion
