  - Credit pack editor with original pricing strategy
  - Stats dashboard with real-time analytics
  - `admin_config` table for flexible configuration storage
  - All admin features fully functional and tested

## Immediate Tasks (Phase 1)

### üöß In Progress
- Clip generation API endpoint
- AI integration with Runway

### ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Up
- Add clip approval workflow UI
- Create sequential clip player
- Implement credit system integration
- Connect system prompt to AI generation

## Key Decisions Made

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (all-in-one solution)
- **AI Model**: Pluggable provider (start with Runway)
- **Admin Panel**: Password-protected configuration management
- **Payments**: Stripe (USD only)
- **Auth**: Google OAuth only (required first)
- **Video Handling**: Sequential playlist (no stitching)
- **Storage**: Private buckets only (auth required)

### Business Constraints
- **Maximum Simplicity**: Auth-first, no temporary states
- **English + USD Only**: Global expansion later
- **Mobile-First**: PWA with offline capabilities
- **Low Scale Initially**: <50 users in MVP phase
- **Cost Target**: $0.25 per clip generation

### Development Approach
- **Auth-First**: All features behind login
- **Admin-Configurable**: System prompts and pricing via admin panel
- **Clip Approval**: Manual confirmation for each clip
- **Simple Playback**: Sequential playlist instead of stitching
- **Clean Setup**: Comprehensive documentation and tooling

## Admin Panel Configuration

### System Prompt
- Editable AI prompt for video generation
- Stored in database, affects all future generations
- Default focused on cinematic, emotional movements

### Credit Packs (Active)
- **Starter Pack**: 5 credits - $15.00 ($3.00/credit)
- **Standard Pack**: 20 credits - $45.00 ($2.25/credit)
- **Premium Pack**: 40 credits - $80.00 ($2.00/credit)

### Model Configuration
- Currently: Runway ML Gen-3
- Ready for future provider additions
- Connection testing available

## Environment Setup Status

### Required Accounts
- [x] Supabase project + Google OAuth
- [x] Admin panel access configured
- [ ] Stripe account  
- [ ] Runway API access
- [ ] Vercel/Netlify deployment

### Database Schema Updates
- [x] `admin_config` table created and populated
- [ ] Add `approved` boolean to clips table
- [ ] Update RLS policies for auth-first approach
- [ ] Create referral tracking tables

## Phase 1 Focus: Core User Experience

### Priority Implementation Order
1. **Clip Generation API**: Connect system prompt to Runway
2. **Clip Approval UI**: User can approve/reject generated clips
3. **Sequential Player**: Play approved clips in order
4. **Credit Integration**: Deduct credits per generation

### Success Criteria for Phase 1
- [ ] Users can generate AI clips from photos
- [ ] System prompt from admin affects generation
- [ ] Approval workflow functional
- [ ] Credits properly deducted
- [ ] Sequential playback working

## Recent Work (December 2024)
